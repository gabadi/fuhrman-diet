- 1/3 cup chopped carrots
- 1/3 cup chopped onions

## Instructions
1. To make the raspberry vinaigrette, bring the vinegar and the cup of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Once boiling, whisk in the arrowroot/cold water mixture and let boil for 2 minutes, but no longer, whisking occasionally. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.
2. In a wide-bottomed saucepan, lightly caramelize the carrots, onions, and celery in the white wine.
3. Add the endive halves, cut side down, one-quarter of the raspberry vinaigrette, and water to cover.
4. Cover and simmer 15 minutes or until tender.
5. Add the orange slices to the pan, cover, and cook for 2 minutes, just to warm the orange slices.
6. Arrange Belgian endive halves and 4 orange slices on four individual plates.
7. Top each with a dollop of herb "cheese" if desired.
8. Drizzle with desired amount of the raspberry vinaigrette and sprinkle with the black walnuts and freshly ground black pepper.
