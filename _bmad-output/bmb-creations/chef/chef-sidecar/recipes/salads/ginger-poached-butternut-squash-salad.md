## Ingredients
- 3 cups low-sodium or no-salt-added vegetable stock
- 1/2 bunch celery, washed, trimmed, and diced
- 1/2 yellow onion, trimmed, peeled, and diced
- 1 red Fresno chili or jalapeño
- 1/4 cup finely minced ginger
- 1/2 large butternut squash, washed, peeled, and cut into 1-inch half-moons
- 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup raisins or other unsulfured dried fruit
- 1/2 bunch dino/lacinato kale, de-stemmed, washed, and finely chopped
- 1/2 pint cherry tomatoes
- 1 cup basil and mint leaves
- 2 tablespoons chopped garlic
- 1/4 cup raw cashews, lightly toasted, coarsely chopped
- 1 cup bean sprouts

## Instructions
1. Place vegetable stock in a high-sided pot and add celery, onion, garlic, chili, and ginger.
2. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a very low simmer (under 180°F). Simmer for 5 minutes, then add the butternut squash.
3. Place a lid on the pot and poach slowly for 20 to 30 minutes.
4. Remove squash with a slotted spoon, place on a plate, and keep warm. Reserve the broth and remaining cooked vegetables.
5. Pour 1/2 cup of the broth into a small bowl and add the rice wine vinegar and raisins to allow the raisins to plump and absorb some broth.
6. Place the kale, sprouts, tomatoes, herbs, and 1/2 cup of cooked vegetables (from the broth) into a large mixing bowl.
7. Puree the raisin mixture with an immersion blender or high-powered blender. Add desired amount to kale salad.
8. Place the salad on large plates, top with the poached squash, and garnish with cashews.
