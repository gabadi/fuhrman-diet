## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup fruit-flavored vinegar (Black Cherry Vinegar)
- 1 cup water
- 2 teaspoons arrowroot powder, dissolved in an additional 1/4 cup cold water
- 4 medium red beets
- 4 cups soft-textured greens such as mâche or baby romaine, washed
- 20 asparagus spears, cut into 1-inch diagonal pieces and blanched in boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes
- 1 cup Herbed "Goat Cheese" (optional)
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
- Freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions
1. Bring the vinegar and the cup of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Once boiling, whisk in the arrowroot/cold water mixture and let boil for 2 minutes, but no longer, whisking occasionally. Remove from the heat and let vinaigrette cool to room temperature.
2. Cut off the tops and tails of the beets, wash thoroughly, and place in a baking dish. Add 1/2 inch of hot water to the baking dish, cover with foil, and roast for 1 hour at 400°F.
3. Remove from the oven, remove the foil, and let cool to room temperature. Run the beets under cold water and rub off the skins.
4. Cut into 1/4-inch-thick round slices and toss with 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette in a mixing bowl.
5. To assemble the salad, place 1 cup of the greens, one-quarter of the asparagus pieces, and then the beet slices on four individual plates.
6. If desired, place a dollop of the herbed "cheese" on each beet slice.
7. Drizzle with desired amount of black cherry vinaigrette.
8. Sprinkle with the walnuts, dill, and freshly ground black pepper.
