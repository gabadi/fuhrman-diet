## Ingredients
- 1 head cauliflower, cut into pieces
- 3 carrots, coarsely chopped
- 1 cup coarsely chopped celery
- 2 leeks, coarsely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons Dr. Fuhrman's VegiZest or no-salt seasoning blend
- 2 cups carrot juice (2 pounds carrots, juiced)
- 4 cups water
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 cup raw cashews (or 1/2 cup raw cashew butter)

## Instructions
1. Place all the ingredients, except the cashews and kale, in a pot.
2. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until the vegetables are just tender.
3. Steam the kale until tender. If using spinach, there is no need to steam it; it will wilt in the hot soup.
4. In a food processor or high-powered blender, blend two-thirds of the soup liquid and vegetables with the cashews until smooth and creamy.
5. Return to the pot and stir in the steamed kale (or raw spinach).
