## Ingredients

### For the Sandwich:
- 4 large portobello mushrooms, stems removed
- 1/2 large red onion, thinly sliced
- 4 whole-grain pitas
- 2 cups large arugula leaves
- 2 medium roasted red bell peppers, drained, seeded, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices

### For the Spread:
- 1/2 cup tahini (pureed sesame seeds) or 2/3 cup unhulled sesame seeds
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- No-salt seasoning blend, adjusted to taste
- 1 teaspoon Bragg Liquid Aminos or low-sodium soy sauce
- 2 pitted dates, chopped
- 1 small clove garlic, chopped

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Arrange mushrooms and onions on a baking sheet and roast until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, make tahini spread by blending all ingredients together until creamy in a food processor or high-powered blender. (If using whole sesame seeds, first blend sesame seeds with 1/4 cup water until creamy and then add the other 1/4 cup water and remaining ingredients.)
3. When mushrooms/onions are done, split pitas in half horizontally and warm slightly.
4. Spread generous amount of tahini on top half of split pita.
5. Place 1/2 cup arugula on bottom half and then 1 mushroom cap (patted dry with paper towels to absorb liquid), sliced onion, and roasted red pepper.

## Notes
- Tahini availability in Argentina needs verification.
