## Instructions
1. For pickled vegetables, see recipe for Nutritarian Pickling Juice. Allow 2 days for vegetables to pickle.
2. If you are not pickling your vegetables, heat 2 tablespoons water in a large saute pan and water-saute the onion, broccoli, carrots, and bell peppers for 5 minutes, adding more water as necessary to keep vegetables from scorching.
3. Add the bok choy and mushrooms, cover, and simmer until vegetables are just tender.
4. Remove the cover and cook off most of the water. Add the spinach and toss until wilted.
5. Blend all dressing ingredients together in a high-powered blender until creamy. Add more water as necessary to adjust consistency.
6. To serve, spoon filling onto a lettuce leaf, add a bit of dressing, and roll up.

## Notes
- Vegetables can be stir-fried for a quick meal or pickled for authentic Korean flavor.
- Pickled vegetables will keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 weeks.
