## Ingredients

### For the Pie Crust:
- 1 cup raw almonds
- 1 teaspoon ground chia seeds
- 1/2 cup pitted dates
- 2 teaspoons water

### For the Filling:
- 1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin
- 1/2 cup pitted dates, soaked in 1/4 cup water
- 1/4 cup raisins
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 2 1/2 tablespoons arrowroot powder
- 1 (10-ounce) package soft tofu

### For the Cashew Cream Topping:
- 1 1/3 cups raw cashews
- 3/4 cup vanilla soy, hemp, or almond milk
- 2/3 cup pitted dates

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. To make the crust, combine the raw almonds and 1 teaspoon ground chia seeds in a food processor. Pulse until finely ground. Add the dates and water and process until the mixture gathers into a ball. Press the mixture into a very lightly oiled 8-inch pie plate. Pre-bake the crust for 5 minutes.
3. To make the filling, blend the pumpkin, dates, and soaking water in a high-powered blender. Add the raisins, spices, arrowroot powder and tofu. Blend until smooth.
4. Pour mixture into prebaked pie shell. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 60 minutes. Uncover and continue baking an additional 15 minutes. Pie filling will firm up as it cools.
5. While pie is in the oven, make the Cashew Cream Topping. Blend all ingredients together in a high-powered blender.
6. Serve with a dollop of Cashew Cream.
