## Quick Info

- **Category:** desserts

- **G-BOMBS:** None

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup Mangosteen Vinegar (or fruit-flavored vinegar)
- 1 cup water
- 2 teaspoons arrowroot powder, dissolved in an additional 1/4 cup cold water
- 8 very ripe Hachiya persimmons, stem removed, unpeeled

## Instructions
1. Bring vinegar and the cup of water to a boil in a small saucepan.
2. Once boiling, whisk in the arrowroot/cold water mixture and let boil for 2 minutes, but no longer, whisking occasionally.
3. Remove from heat and cool.
4. In a high-powered blender, puree persimmons and 1/2 cup of the vinegar mixture (vinaigrette) until it reaches the consistency of a salad dressing.
5. Pour into small bowls, cover with plastic wrap, and chill.
6. For a more elegant presentation, pour into champagne, cordial, or martini glasses, cover with plastic wrap, and chill.
7. The pudding will firm up if chilled overnight.

## Notes
- Hachiya persimmons should be eaten when very ripe (completely soft even at the bottom edge). When ready to eat, the flesh becomes sweet, aromatic, and almost liquid.
- If desired, serve with a dollop of Cashew Cream Topping.
