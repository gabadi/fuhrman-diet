- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract or 1 vanilla bean

## Instructions
1. Blend all ingredients together in a high-powered blender until smooth and creamy.

## Notes
- Freeze ripe bananas at least 12 hours in advance. To freeze bananas, peel, cut in thirds, and wrap tightly in plastic wrap.
- Using a vanilla bean will add a subtle, yet complex flavor. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape the inner gel-like lining from the bean using a dull knife.
