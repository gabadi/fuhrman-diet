- 1/2 cup water
- 1 banana

## Instructions
1. In a high-powered blender, blend the oats until a flour forms. Add to a large bowl.

8. Place the unsweetened chocolate in a microwave-proof bowl and heat in the microwave for 1 minute, stir, and heat for another 30 seconds or until completely melted.
9. Remove pan from freezer. Using a small spoon, drizzle with chocolate. Cut into squares.
