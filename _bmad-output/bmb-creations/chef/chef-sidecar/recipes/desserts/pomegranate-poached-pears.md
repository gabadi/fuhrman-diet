## Ingredients

### For the Pears:
- 4 medium Bosc pears
- 2 cups pomegranate juice or red wine
- 1 whole cinnamon stick
- 4 whole cloves
- 2 tablespoons goji berries

### For the Chocolate Sauce:
- 1/2 cup frozen blueberries
- 1/2 cups soy, hemp, or almond milk
- 1/2 cup pitted dates
- 1/4 cup raw macadamia nuts
- 1 tablespoon unsweetened natural nonalkalized cocoa
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon turmeric (to adjust color)

### For the Raspberry Sauce:
- 10 ounces frozen red raspberries (about 1 1/2 cups), thawed

## Instructions
1. Peel pears, leaving stems intact. Slice a little off the bottom of each pear so that they stand up.
2. In a large saucepan, place pears standing up snugly together. Pour in pomegranate juice or wine. Add cinnamon, cloves, and goji berries.
3. Gently simmer, covered, for about 20 minutes until pears are tender.
4. Remove pears and refrigerate until ready to serve. Reduce poaching liquid until it becomes a syrup.
5. For the chocolate sauce, place blueberries, soy milk, dates, macadamia nuts, cocoa powder, vanilla, and turmeric in a blender. Blend until very smooth and creamy. Add more soy milk if needed.
6. For the raspberry sauce, place defrosted raspberries in a blender and blend until smooth. Push through sieve to remove seeds. Mix in poaching syrup.
7. Place a generous dollop of chocolate sauce on dessert plate. Place pear on chocolate and drizzle raspberry sauce over pear.
