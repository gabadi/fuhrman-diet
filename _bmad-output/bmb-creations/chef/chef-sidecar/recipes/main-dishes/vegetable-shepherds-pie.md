4. Add spinach and toss. Drain and remove vegetables, reserving vegetable liquid in pot.
5. Whisk cornstarch into carrot juice and whisk into boiling vegetable liquid until it thickens.
6. Add sautéed mushrooms, vegetables, and crumbled tofu to sauce and toss to combine.
7. Divide mixture into two 8-inch pie pans. Top each with 1/4 cup nuts.
8. Spread sweet potatoes over the top and sprinkle with remaining nuts.
9. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until hot and nuts are light brown. Sprinkle with parsley.
