### For the Tofu Ricotta:
- 16 ounces extra-firm tofu, drained well
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons minced shallots
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup fresh basil, chopped
- No-salt seasoning blend or 2 tablespoons Dr. Fuhrman's MatoZest
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 2 teaspoons ground chia seeds
- Dash of black pepper

### For the Vegetables:

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. To make the tofu "ricotta," place the tofu in a bowl and mash until crumbly. Add remaining ingredients and mix until well combined and the consistency resembles ricotta cheese.
3. To prepare the vegetables, sauté the broccoli, mushrooms, bell peppers, and spinach, without water, over low heat for 5 minutes or just until tender.
4. To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the pasta sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.
5. Layer the zucchini slices, sautéed vegetables, and tofu "ricotta" and then spread with pasta sauce.
6. Repeat the layers, ending with the tofu "ricotta."
7. Spread the remaining pasta sauce on top and bake, uncovered, for approximately 45 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.
8. Garnish with the shredded basil.
