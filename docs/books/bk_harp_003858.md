*Cassie and Dave, alarmed by increasing symptoms associated with poor health and aging, made a decision to Eat to Live. Hoping for many positive changes for themselves, they were pleasantly surprised by the added benefits for the rest of the family.*

**BEFORE:** 162 pounds (Cassie) and 250 pounds (Dave)

**AFTER:** 111 pounds (Cassie) and 145 pounds (Dave)

My husband, Dave, and I have been happily married for twenty-five years. We have four children, all in their twenties, and a young grandson. We were only in our late forties, yet we felt very old, unhealthy, tired, and frustrated. We experienced brain fog and lack of energy daily, constant sinus infections, migraines, back pain, indigestion, eczema, severe mood swings, and agonizing cravings and food addictions. Our toxic diet and sedentary lifestyle were taking their toll.

One transformative day we discovered Dr. Fuhrman's teachings. We immediately threw out all our processed foods and eliminated meat, dairy, oil, salt, and sweeteners from our diet. *Eat to Live* became our daily manual. It provided us with the knowledge that we needed to succeed. Our motivation wasn't weight driven; rather, it was driven by a deep passion to get healthy and change our lives for the better.

Our physical and mental transformations have been amazing! After thirty-five years, Dave even finally quit coffee and cigarettes. He and I now walk, run, or hike at least twenty to twenty-five miles a week and incorporate cardio and calorie-burning exercises into our daily routine. We both feel great.

Our transformation and passionate commitment to our new nutritarian diet style have allowed our new lifestyle to positively affect our children as well. They have also incorporated our food choices into their diets and, as a result, have experienced significant weight loss and overall health improvements.

The one truth that we have learned with our nutritarian lifestyle is that we all have the power to take control of our own health destiny—it's in each one of us!

*Kathleen spent her life on the dieting merry-go-round as the result of food addiction and cravings. Her dysfunctional relationship with food controlled her life, until she took back her power.*

**BEFORE:** 228 pound

**AFTER:** 163 pounds (so far)

Food was the perfect friend. This friend never, ever let me down. If I was sad, food was there for me. If I wanted to celebrate, my "friend" lifted me up and celebrated with me. If I was bored, food filled my time. If life was too painful to contemplate, my friend distracted me, easing my pain. Truly, food felt like the best friend I'd ever had.

The standard American diet brought me solace, comfort, celebration. It was always present when I was lonely. However, it also brought me pain and despair because this relationship caused me to gain an enormous amount of weight. It exacerbated a genetic condition, causing me to end up with such severe osteoarthritis that I had to have a total knee replacement. I was only forty-seven years old. The standard American diet, and my addiction to food, chipped away at my self-esteem and self-care.

Clearly, the sensible thing to do was to end this unhealthy relationship. But, as with all dysfunctional relationships, ending it also meant giving up the good parts that I desperately wanted. How does one reconcile that? I suspect that the answer to this question is deeply personal and different for each of us. For me, it took watching my dad slowly die, a victim of the standard American diet. I remember visiting my dad in the ICU after he'd pulled through yet another crisis and suggesting to him that he could improve his health by improving his diet. He shook his head and said, "Kathleen, I can't give up my food." I'll never forget his words as he sat in his hospital bed under the harsh fluorescent lights with the sound of monitors beeping in the background. He had just nearly died, and yet he couldn't give up his unhealthy foods. Wow.

That's addiction for you. Not only did I miss him terribly when he passed, but I also saw my own future. My addiction to the standard American diet was no less powerful than my dad's, and I was terrified.

I worked with Dr. Fuhrman's food addiction counselor, who helped me recognize my dysfunctional relationship with food. I realized that my addiction to food was no different from an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Aren't we so very fortunate that our addiction is socially sanctioned and it takes place in clean church halls, restaurants, and our very own kitchens? Aren't we lucky that we don't have to hide in dirty alleys to get our fixes? And isn't it incredibly tragic that we have the same exact sort of dopamine-craving, soul-crushing, health-destroying compulsion that the drug addict has?

I also learned that if you're running with a crowd that causes you trouble, you end up making poor decisions. This crowd doesn't respect you. It hurts you. You have to cut those friends loose no matter what positive aspects the relationship brings to you. For me, unhealthy food was my dysfunctional "gang."

As so often happens when you remove dysfunctional relationships from your life, you open up space to form new, healthy connections. I now have gorgeous, fresh, crisp vegetables as friends. I have decadently sweet, juicy fruit. I have happy belly-filling beans, hearty whole grains, and luscious nuts and seeds. My new friends nourish me and never hurt me the way the standard American diet always did. Now that I have a much healthier relationship with food, I'm 60 pounds lighter and I'm still losing weight.

Breaking free of food addiction is difficult, but once you have the knowledge provided by Dr. Fuhrman's research and writings, you can never un-know it. Once you've had the experience of living in a truly nourished body, you can never again tolerate the toxic feelings that come from toxic food. Once you start to become active, you can never tolerate stagnation again. Once you learn to listen to your own body, you'll always hear its wisdom.

I have never really thought of it as food addiction, but reading what you have said, I see that my father died from food addiction. He was a physician and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when he was thirty-seven. After years of using medications (eleven of them) to treat his symptoms while buying candy and pastries in bulk, he died at the ripe age of sixty-four. I now see that this was addictive behavior because he knew that changing his diet would make his symptoms go away. He knew what the consequences of his behavior would be and yet he kept gorging on unhealthy food for twentyfive years. Twenty-five years of hospital stays and all sorts of nasty diabetic side effects. He was not a dummy, yet he engaged in this irrational behavior.

*Heather doesn't worry about the scale anymore. She eats what she wants and is far healthier and headache-free.*

**BEFORE:** 201 pounds

**AFTER:** 125 pounds

I'm a thirty-eight-year-old wife and mother of three. For as long as I can remember, I've suffered from horrible, debilitating migraines. I couldn't sleep. I was exhausted all the time. I didn't have the energy to get up and play with my son and would nod off while driving (yikes!). I suffered from terrible seasonal allergies and had an unexplained facial rash that didn't go away for months. I also had mood swings, although my family tells me that I was just plain grumpy. I started taking an antidepressant for anxiety.

I tried to start my own plan to regain my health. I ordered a juicer and juiced for about four weeks. Although I felt great, I knew this wasn't a way I could live long term. I considered this time as just a detox for my body in preparation for what was yet to come.

Inspired to learn more, I did some research and found Dr. Fuhrman. I discovered his books, bought one, and read it in one day. This book is now marked up like my Bible.

I used to be a food label reader (you can see where that got me), but I've since learned that I was looking for the wrong things—carbs and protein, for example, which are emphasized in the standard American diet. I don't buy anything processed or packaged, so labels hardly matter to me anymore. However, when I buy canned goods, such as beans or tomato sauce, I buy organic and am always vigilant about the amount of salt and sugar they contain. I will NEVER eat the other way again, EVER.

Since becoming a nutritarian I've lost weight, but more importantly, I feel FANTASTIC! I haven't had a cold in over a year. I no longer suffer from migraines or headaches. I have energy. I sleep well. I stopped taking antidepressants, and I no longer suffer from anxiety. I feel GREAT all the time!

*Ronna didn't need to lose a significant amount of weight, but her food cravings and addictions were ruling her life—until she embraced a nutritarian lifestyle.*

**BEFORE:** 146 pounds **AFTER:** 116 pounds

My head was once filled with a myriad of nutrition theories. Self-help books and fad diets dictated my rules for weight loss. I was only concerned with finding the right diet program for a "miraculous" weight loss. To me, increasing vitamins and minerals meant consuming supplements and fortified foods, such as orange juice and cereals. Having salad or a side of some vegetable was my version of observing the food pyramid. I avoided junk food and tried to eat less—but it did not work.

At age eleven, I was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid, which meant I could only lose weight through extreme calorie restriction and/or excessive physical activity. I was a classic yo-yo dieter. I could never stay away from sugar for very long. I became addicted to sweets and felt I needed to diet like crazy to compensate.

After attending one of Dr. Fuhrman's Health Immersion programs, however, I started reading his books, which dramatically shifted my perspective on many health-related matters. Before the immersion, I fed my desires daily—coffee with cream, a little wine and cheese, several bites of a gluten-free ice-cream sandwich and a few "healthy snacks," which I thought I needed every few hours.

My erroneous beliefs didn't end there. I had self-diagnosed myself as hypoglycemic, but I wasn't. I was just going through withdrawals from my toxic diet. I also believed that my metabolism would slow down with age and that my hypothyroid disease was working against me, both of which proved to be myths.

Becoming a nutritarian changed my life. I don't just look different; I think and live differently. I have shed 30 pounds from my 5-foot-2-inch frame. My energy battery is always fully charged, and I'm no longer a slave to addictive eating habits. I'm happier and think more clearly. I feel a sense of balance, ease in movement, and enhanced self-confidence. And, most importantly, my cravings and the constant "noise" in my head related to food, body weight, and self-image are completely gone.

*Marcie realized that rapid weight loss is possible and sustainable, without deprivation, because, to her pleasant surprise, eating vegetables is far more enjoyable than she ever imagined.*

**AFTER:** Lost 90 pounds in less than a year

It was the beginning of another year and I was (reluctantly) determined to lose weight. I felt terrible and had very little energy. I prayed to God to help me. By the third day of my diet, my husband reconnected with an old employer, who handed him a copy of *Eat to Live.* He said it helped him beat colon cancer. I took this as an answer to my prayers. I read the book and started the nutritarian diet style.

After following the program for about six weeks, I had my lightbulb moment—exactly how Dr. Fuhrman describes it. I began to look forward to eating vegetables. The best part about the nutritarian diet style is that you don't have to weigh your food, and you can actually eat however much you want—all while losing weight! The fact that these foods are found in nature and aren't processed was a huge selling point for me. All of the foods on this diet are what God intended for us to eat.

This plan worked for me when other diets failed, not only because other diets (like Atkins) were hard to maintain, but because depriving and counting calories was just too hard. Of course, the weight coming off rapidly made it easy to continue. Besides the weight loss, I started to think more clearly and focus better. I stopped getting headaches, and I started to enjoy working out. My bouts with depression went away completely. That alone makes it worth staying with this program.

By the fall, I had lost 90 pounds. I can't tell you how wonderful I feel today. Dr. Fuhrman's books are a gift and contain all the research that explains why these foods are so good for us. This knowledge made it easier for me to stick with the plan. Now, I eat for health.

*Kate lost 64 pounds and now feels "back in the land of the living." She's no longer chronically fatigued from her autoimmune disease.*

**BEFORE:** 170 pounds

**AFTER:** 106 pounds

I had always considered myself a healthy eater. I stuck to organic veggies and meats, never drank colas or ate candy bars. I scrutinized the ingredients in my food. But the older I got, the worse I began to feel. I was up to 170 pounds, my total cholesterol was at 239, and my fatigue felt bottomless. I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia, a debilitating autoimmune disease. I was told that there really wasn't much that could be done other than take vitamin B12, which I started immediately. Unfortunately, however, it didn't really help my fatigue.

At this point I became completely stopped in life—I couldn't work, I had zero energy, and I felt miserable all the time. No doctor at any time ever mentioned food as maybe contributing to all this. While trying to find out more about autoimmune diseases, I came across Dr. Fuhrman's *Eat to Live.* Both my husband and I started reading it immediately, and it made total sense to us. We both recognized that food was the one constant in our lives that had never really changed, despite all the different diet combinations and ratios we had tried in the past.

We both committed 100 percent to this way of eating. We've been following it for 21 ⁄2 years. As a result, I went from 170 pounds to 106 pounds. My cholesterol went from 239 to 129, and my dress size went from a size 14 to a size 2! Most important, however, is my newfound energy and tremendous quality of life I now enjoy.

When people meet me for the first time, they can't believe that just a few short years earlier I was house-bound and had virtually no life at all. Now I'm actively back in the land of the living, and it's an honor to be able to share with people my story about how simple it is to get back your health and vitality by just following what Dr. Fuhrman says.

*It took hitting rock bottom for Susan to realize that the solution to her health problems was within her grasp.*

**BEFORE:** 350 pounds

**AFTER:** 140 pounds

As another birthday approached, I found myself at a whopping 350 pounds. I was diabetic, hypertensive, and very depressed. Ironically, I only had to look as far as my own bookshelf to find a prescription to better health, *Eat to Live* by Dr. Fuhrman. It was signed: "Wishing you all good health and much happiness always, Joel Fuhrman."

I remember my first meeting with Dr. Fuhrman. He let me know in no uncertain terms that my current lifestyle was going to lead to disease and an early grave. But I continued my destructive course, and continued to live to eat.

Through the years, I tried many different weight-loss programs and found only temporary successes. In 2005, at 350 pounds, I had a lapband procedure, probably one of the worst decisions I have ever made. The restrictive band made it almost impossible to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet. In fact, it made it most comfortable to eat foods that were literally sugar-coated. Eventually, I had the band opened to its fullest extent and continued trying new fads.

I finally took *Eat to Live* off the shelf, knowing that in my hands was my greatest hope for a healthy future. Since then, I have lost 210 pounds. I now enjoy physical activities. On my fiftieth birthday, I climbed a mountain in Woodstock, New York—and then enjoyed a meal of kale, roasted beets, and beans! I ride my bicycle with my son, too. Our last trek was fourteen miles, much of it uphill. My husband and I traveled to Paris to visit our daughter, a vacation I never would have dreamed of because of the expense and humiliation of buying two airplane seats for one obese person.

I love telling my story. This diet style is easy to follow. I rarely weigh or measure any food. I don't feel like I'm on a diet—because if I'm hungry, I eat.

The nutritarian diet style is *not* a burden—being morbidly obese and sidelined from your own life *is*!

*You are not alone in your struggle with your weight and food addictions. A successful nutritarian and contributor to my blog since 2009, Emily has inspired thousands of people to change their lives.*

Since my early twenties I had adopted a dieting mentality that resulted in a 100-pound weight gain. I was always dieting, and no matter how ridiculous a plan would be, I'd try to follow it for a few days until my body couldn't stand the nutritional deprivation any longer. I'd then eat everything in sight. Or I'd get so exasperated trying to follow restrictive rituals, like counting calories and points or weighing or measuring food, that I'd quit whatever diet I was currently on. I ended up literally starving myself to obesity.

I wasn't interested in the science behind toxic hunger, food addiction, optimal health, and longevity; I just wanted a quick way to lose weight. I earmarked and started following the Six-Week Plan in *Eat to Live,* but didn't read the rest of the book. By the second day, when symptoms of detox started to surface, I caved in and immediately went back to my old way of eating. This continued on and off for the next five years.

When my health had deteriorated to the point that I was scared of having a heart attack or stroke, I was ready to radically change my way of thinking and eating. I was ready to get rid of the dieting mentality and replace it with eating for excellent health for the rest of my life.

I knew Dr. Fuhrman had the answer, and I went back to his teachings with a new refocused commitment. I no longer focused on what I *couldn't* eat until I lost weight; instead, I focused on consuming colorful and vibrant foods that I *could* eat to give my body the best opportunity to live in optimal health. I made the firm commitment to get my health back by carefully following Dr. Fuhrman's nutritarian approach.

Within a year, I'd lost 100 pounds and eradicated from my life heart disease, hypertension, prediabetes, chronic fatigue, brain fog, malaise, low back pain, cracked heels, and painful boils. But most importantly, the overwhelming cravings for fattening, processed junk foods that consumed my every waking moment gradually subsided and then completely went away. For the first time in my adult life I was free from the "dieting mentality" that failed me miserably.

### **Change the Mind and the Body Will Follow**

*Intrigued by the experiences of others, Emily began interviewing successful nutritarians for my blog and gleaned invaluable nuggets of truth from many other real-life success stories. With my guidance and from these experiences and observations, Emily compiled twelve vital tips for losing weight—and keeping it off—the nutritarian way.*

#### *1. It Takes Commitment.*

Success has nothing to do with economic status, nationality, education, social standing, professional training, career choice, a stable upbringing, or even support from loved ones. Success is a direct result of thoroughly studying, understanding, and assimilating the science behind Dr. Fuhrman's nutritional recommendations—and then making the decision to tenaciously earn your health back, no matter what. Success is having both feet in at all times, not "trying" to eat high-nutrient foods during the week and indulging on the weekends, or eating for health only when it's convenient. Trying only leaves the door cracked open to indulging on a whim. All who have succeeded made the firm decision to commit 100 percent.

#### *2. Perspective Determines Outcome.*

Those who succeed with the nutritarian approach view it as an opportunity to "earn" health back. This perspective enables a person to get past toxic cravings to thoroughly enjoy great-tasting foods, in their natural state. Conversely, those who repeatedly fail have the mind-set of dieting. They view the nutritarian approach as just another diet designed only to lose weight and subsequently focus on restriction and deprivation. This mentality invites self-pity and cheating, which doesn't allow your taste buds to change or let you break free of the vicious cycle of toxic addiction.

#### *3. Change a Mistaken Identity.*

People become what they believe to be true about themselves and what they repeatedly tell others. If people believe they are failures, they will fail. If they tell everyone that they are a compulsive overeater, they will compulsively overeat in times of stress. It's vitally important to declare and believe in an identity congruent with who you want to be. If you want to be a nutritariansomeone who eats high-nutrient foods to meet the body's biological needs for optimal nutrition—then declare it! Make it your identity. Where the mind goes, the body will follow.

#### *4. Ditch the Wagon.*

The wagon mentality and dieting go hand in hand. "I fell off the wagon" basically translates into, "I blew it so I might as well eat anything I want now." Eating for optimal health is a lifetime endeavor of making wise choices each and every day. Slipups do happen from time to time, but never allow a slipup to turn into an excuse to wallow in disappointment, self-pity, and false guilt that could potentially lead to a full-fledged binge.

#### *5. Avoid the Moderation Myth.*

When it comes to toxic foods, there's no such thing as eating in moderation. Taking just one bite of an addictive food can be just as dangerous as smoking one cigarette for a former nicotine addict. Don't believe the moderation myth that you might hear from physicians, counselors, ministers, friends, coworkers, or relatives. The truth is that just one bite of an addictive food can do great harm. It's much easier to keep addictive cravings extinguished than to be continually fighting obsessive compulsions, because it only takes a tiny spark to ignite them.

#### *6. There Are No Shortcuts.*

Everyone has to cross the threshold of withdrawal from toxic foods, which, for most people, is no fun. Detoxification (or toxic hunger) can be unpleasant. You might experience headaches, nausea, weakness, fatigue, shakiness, and irritability that can last up to several days. But once the symptoms have resolved, and if you no longer consume toxic foods, the symptoms don't return. Salt is a particularly tough habit to kick, but once the addiction to salt is gone, your taste buds change, and the subtle flavors of fruits and vegetables in their natural state become highly enjoyable.

#### *7. Tomorrow Never Comes.*

Waiting until after the holidays or a special occasion to begin eating for health is a bad idea. Telling yourself you'll "start tomorrow" is a lie. There's always another celebration or family event. After Thanksgiving, Hanukkah,

and Christmas comes the Super Bowl, followed by Valentine's Day, Passover, Easter, Mother's Day, graduation parties, multiple birthday parties, a wedding or two, a Father's Day cookout, summer barbecues and picnics, county fairs, fall festivals, Halloween, and then the year-end holidays all over again. You must make the firm decision to eat for health each day and hold fast to that commitment no matter what the calendar says.

#### *8. The Refrigerator Is Never the Solution.*

Eating is never a solution to any problem. Ever. Emotional health is never achieved via the refrigerator, cupboard, or drive-thru window. Life is full of ups and downs, joys and sorrows, pleasures and pains; that's why our lives are interesting and, ultimately, fulfilling. Address emotional issues by talking to a professional counselor or a trusted family member or friend, or join a support group. Addictive foods and drugs are never the solution.

#### *9. Abstinence Is Important.*

The purpose of an established boundary is to keep you safe. In that safe place you'll find freedom from addiction and disease. Food addiction can be as serious as alcoholism and drug addiction. It destroys lives. A commitment to abstain from all processed foods and junk food is often needed. Abstinence is radical, but it produces the best results. That means if you are a food addict and have cravings and trigger foods that drive unhealthful eating, then you need to abstain from these known triggers. The most effective way to beat the addictive drive to overconsume alcohol, drugs, or sweets is abstinence for at least a few months. Many people are highly addicted to sweets and refined carbohydrates and need to abstain.

#### *10. Have a Plan and Stick to It.*

Getting out and staying out of food addiction isn't that hard per se, but you must be vigilant and persistent at all times. When I finally committed to follow Dr. Fuhrman's nutritarian approach, I typed out his Six-Week Plan, printed off several copies, and had them laminated. I put one in my purse and another in my car; I posted one on my bathroom mirror and another on the refrigerator. I even attached one to my ironing board! That tangible plan made all the decisions for me. Three months later I was 40 pounds lighter, and my blood

pressure, fasting blood sugar levels, and lipid profile were all normal; and even more importantly, the overwhelming cravings for toxic foods were completely gone!

#### *11. Be Prepared At All Times.*

Plan ahead and always have food prepared in advance. Your health destiny is your responsibility, so be prepared at all times. Unlike junk food dieting, no factory-prepared meals will be delivered to your doorstep. Keep your refrigerator well stocked with freshly cleaned vegetables, fruits, and cooked bean soups for quick meals. Never wait until the refrigerator is empty to plan and prepare more food. Once you establish a routine of preparation, it will become second nature—but in the beginning, you have to make this habit a top priority to develop it.

#### *12. Never Give Up.*

Hard times happen. When life is turned upside down, it takes everything within yourself to muster the strength to keep going in the direction of health. But even when you have challenging days, stay committed to making wise food choices as best as you can. There is never a valid excuse to quit. As Dr. Fuhrman states: "It will take strength, it will take effort, but the pleasures and rewards that you'll get from a healthy life will be priceless."

*McKinley adopted a nutritarian lifestyle, which helped her identify—and overcome—the root of her food-related anxiety. She now feels free to enjoy her life in full.*

**BEFORE:** 160 pounds **AFTER:** 125 pounds

Though I'm only twenty-six years old, I can firmly say that becoming a nutritarian has given me my life back. Before discovering Dr. Fuhrman and his health equation, my life was completely dominated by a fear of food, binge eating, cyclical dieting, weight gain, and poor physical condition. I found myself trying diets one by one, my weight constantly fluctuating, my cravings spiraling totally out of control, my feelings of shame and failure immense and unspeakably devastating. I literally spent years of my life walking around with a notebook recording every single thing I ate.

I came across Dr. Fuhrman's nutritarian diet style at a very painful period in my life. I had lost two pregnancies in a relatively short period of time and my mother was starting to show signs of kidney damage following several years of a high-protein diet to control diabetes.

At first, I was very skeptical, but as I continued to read, my heart began to race. Here was a plan backed by literally thousands of research papers, and the people who followed it were reversing many types of conditions—from autoimmune disorders to diabetes to heart disease.

For the first time in my life, I haven't lost hope and I haven't given up. I no longer suffer from fear, food restriction, and despair. Physically, I'm no longer troubled by the frightening pain around the varicose veins in my right knee and calf, the chronic anemia, the restless leg syndrome, the frequent insomnia, the periods of IBS-like symptoms, the severe mood swings and depression, the migraines, poor complexion, dry mouth, and chapped skin. My life feels normal now, and balanced. I now enjoy a loving relationship with my body that is founded in a thorough understanding that wellness is almost exclusively the result of nutrition and lifestyle.

But my greatest joy is this: After seeing my sustained enthusiasm and conviction for the nutritarian lifestyle, my mom, a fifteen-plus-year diabetic and a Hoosier girl who loved typical Midwest fare, started Dr. Fuhrman's knowledge-based program early last fall. She's now very happy living the nutritarian life. Together, we're learning and working with the goal that she will be off all medications by the end of this year!

*Julie's life was a revolving door of doctor's visits and antibiotics. She discovered that more pharmaceuticals aren't the solution to health problems; nutrientdense eating is.*

**BEFORE:** More than 225 pounds

**AFTER:** 150 pounds

My journey to health started fourteen months ago. I was lying on the couch with my three-year-old. Both of us were sick—again. He had a double ear infection, and I had sinusitis and pneumonia. I was on my fifth course of antibiotics in four months. I had been suffering with a headache for months at that point, and my migraine medications had stopped working. I had to go to the doctor to get shots for my migraines, and when they didn't work, I had to go to the urgent care clinic to get stronger shots. I was missing work because of headaches. It was awful.

My total cholesterol was just under 200, and the last time I had seen my doctor, he had told me that I needed to start watching my blood pressure because it was high too. My polycystic ovary syndrome was out of control. I was taking 300 milligrams of progesterone, but the pain was still horrible.

I knew I needed to make a change, but I had tried all kinds of diets, with no success. I felt hopeless. One life-changing day, I happened to hear Dr. Fuhrman on television speak about a different kind of food pyramid and a way to nourish my body and lose weight at the same time. I was inspired. I committed to following the nutritarian diet style for six weeks. I figured what did I have to lose? Six weeks later I had lost 22 pounds.

I now weigh 150 pounds. And I haven't had a single migraine headache. My polycystic ovary syndrome has disappeared. I don't even get premenstrual syndrome anymore! I don't get sick like I did before either. My husband says he isn't afraid I'm going to die in my sleep, like he used to be because I snored so much and would stop breathing. I have energy. I can play with my kids. I'm glad to say I'm off all of my medications—progesterone gone! Allegra, gone! Albuterol, gone! Flonase, gone! Sudafed, gone! All migraine medications, gone!

*Catherine discovered that weight loss isn't the only benefit to incorporating superior nutrition into her life. She also found that food is "healing medicine" that provides "life-giving energy" for her body.*

**BEFORE:** 166 pounds

**AFTER:** 128 pounds

Last summer I knew I had to do something about my weight. My fiftieth birthday was looming, and I couldn't bear the thought of reaching this milestone with an extra 30 to 40 pounds on my body. I also wanted to feel better. More often than not, my mediocre eating habits had left me feeling chaotic, lethargic, and overwhelmed, in addition to having a "meno-pot" belly and fat rolls on my back and hips! I have struggled with anxiety and attention deficit issues all of my life, and my standard American diet provided me with little ammunition for effective coping and flourishing.

I had been looking for a guide to healthy eating that wasn't complicated, and I struck gold when I discovered Dr. Fuhrman's website, which enabled me to carefully track my nutritarian journey.

I was uncertain at first as I roamed grocery store aisles buying kale, collard greens, and leeks; sunflower seeds, walnuts and cashews, currants, Medjool dates and pomegranates, and mushrooms of all kinds. Yet within a matter of days, I was more alert and energetic—the brain "fog" or "malaise" that had hovered over my life for so long seemed to have lifted.

When I first committed to healthy eating at the end of August, I weighed 166 pounds. My original plan had been to follow Dr. Fuhrman's nutritarian diet until my fiftieth birthday in late November. But I soon realized that I was on a life-changing and lifelong journey in which food was about healing and wholeness. I'm struck by how little I knew about nutrition. I knew about the benefits of exercise, but I didn't know much about how food could be such healing medicine and life-giving energy for my body. I love that I'm eating to protect my body against cancer and dementia and helping ensure that I can live a healthy, full life into old age.

*Claudia was a "Vegjunkatarian," mistaking her avoidance of meat for healthy eating until she turned to a nutritarian approach and realized true health with renewed energy.*

**BEFORE:** 120 pounds

**AFTER:** 90 pounds

I've been a vegetarian since I was fifteen years old. My vegetarian diet was similar to the disease-promoting diet that most Americans eat, minus the meat, of course. I was addicted to junk foods like pizza, French fries, grilled cheese sandwiches, and vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup. I seemed to always struggle either to lose weight or keep it off. Eventually I eliminated all dairy products, which brought my cholesterol down to a healthy level, but I was still eating disease-promoting foods.

I was always a low-energy person and didn't like to exercise. Deprivation dieting and exercise were both burdens to me, so I didn't stick with either of them. I also developed a large fibroid on my uterus, which placed limitations on my ability to be physically active.

I had been following a starch-based vegan diet. I had lost some weight, but I always felt hungry. I constantly thought about the next meal and had to carefully count calories in order to avoid overeating. My skin looked pale and was extremely dry. I then discovered and began following Dr. Fuhrman's nutritarian program. I am now vibrant, colorful, and alive—functioning every day at my very best and enjoying life to the fullest! I enjoy the food that I eat now, and I love the fact that I can eat this way, feel great, and stay at an ideal weight. I now enjoy an active life and have the energy to do so much more than I ever did before.

I love knowing that I'm in control of my health destiny, and that I'm not doomed to suffer and die from chronic diseases that plague many Americans. It doesn't matter how many times you've tried and failed in the past—anyone can do this.

### **Tips for Preparing Artichokes**

To cook an artichoke, slice 1 inch off the tip. Cut off about ½ inch or less of the very bottom piece of the stem to expose the fresh green bottom, keeping the remaining stem attached. Then, using a large, sharp knife, slice the artichoke in half lengthwise. Once sliced in half, you can see the fuzzy inedible choke part. Use a small, pointed knife to cut a deep half-moon-shaped incision where the heart meets the choke. Scoop out and discard

the fibrous and hairy choke from the center of each half. Place the artichoke in a steamer basket over several inches of water. Bring the water to a boil, cover, and steam for eighteen minutes. Set the artichoke aside until it's cool enough to handle.

To eat, peel off the outer leaves one at a time. Tightly grip the outer end of the leaf, place the opposite end in your mouth, and pull through your teeth to remove the soft, pulpy, delicious portion of the leaf. You can also scrape off the edible portion with a butter knife. Then you can eat it plain or prepare a healthful dip or dressing to use as a dip. Continue until all the leaves are removed. Cut the remaining heart into pieces and enjoy!

### **Tip for Preparing Broccoli**

Cut off the stems from the florets and cut them in quarters, lengthwise, first in half and then in half again. Steam the cut stems and florets for about thirteen minutes. Or, if you like the stems more tender, put them in the pot to steam for two minutes and then add the florets for thirteen minutes more.

*Donald changed every aspect of his life for the better once he was clearly presented with the simple logic of the power of nutrition.*

**BEFORE:** 298 pounds

**ONE YEAR LATER:** 181 pounds

I'm fifty-one years old. I used to weigh about 300 pounds. When you're covered in a layer of fat, you know you aren't at your best, and it's hard to be happy. I was listless and felt that I wasn't going to live long if I didn't do something about my weight. I tried to lose weight on my own but didn't know how. It's not easy to break the food addiction that starts in childhood, forced on us by family, friends, food companies, and advertisers.

I heard Dr. Fuhrman on PBS. What he said made sense. It was logical and based on facts. I started to get excited, thinking that the nutritarian diet style might work for me. I decided that this was something I had to do—not just to lose weight, but to feel healthy. I got rid of everything unhealthy in my kitchen—and was left with bare cupboards! I went to a local health food store and bought fruits and veggies.

After nine months, I went from 298 pounds down to 181 pounds, from a 52-inch waist to a 36-inch waist, and from an XXXL shirt to large or medium.

I feel so much better now. I really am a new person. People can tell the difference by my big smile, my good posture, and my newfound energy. My only regret is that I didn't find out about nutritarianism sooner.

It feels great when everyone who knows you (and even people who don't!) stop and ask about your weight loss and tell you how good you look. I tell them about Dr. Fuhrman. I want to spread the word and help others achieve their health goals.

It's not easy to make these kinds of changes in your life, but Dr. Fuhrman gives you the knowledge to succeed. Once you can control what you eat, you can have the inner strength to control everything in your life.

*Rod's doctor concluded that genetics predetermined Rod's health and that medication was the only solution. Rod refused to accept that and found that a nutritarian approach was his answer.*

**WEIGHT BEFORE:** 215 pounds

**WEIGHT AFTER:** 145 pounds

**TOTAL CHOLESTEROL BEFORE:** 231

**TOTAL CHOLESTEROL AFTER:** 127

I had just received the results of my annual physical. For the fourth straight year, my total cholesterol was over 215; this year it was 231. The doctor called me and wanted me to start taking a statin drug. Why, I wondered, did I have to take medicine to reduce my cholesterol?

One December evening I received an e-mail from a friend. She had read Dr. Fuhrman's *Eat for Health,* had been following the nutritarian diet style for five months, and had seen her cholesterol level drop drastically. That's when I realized I had found the answer to my dilemma.

After three days of exercise and eating according to Dr. Fuhrman's advice, I lost 6 pounds! As I continued to eat green vegetables, fruits, beans, and a few nuts, I started to feel better. My cravings for processed foods and bad carbohydrates began to fade away. My energy level improved, and I was inspired to eat the foods that fueled my body.

About eight weeks later, I had my cholesterol rechecked. My total cholesterol had dropped from 231 to 127. My HDL went from 35 to 34. My LDL dropped from 168 to 82, and my triglycerides dropped from 142 to 56. Doctors told me I was just fighting genetics, yet this program proved otherwise.

Dr. Fuhrman's approach is successful because it focuses on what you *can* eat. You don't have to count points or measure out food—you just have to eat the *right* foods. I've tried many diets, but they weren't sustainable. Dr. Fuhrman's approach teaches you how to eat for a lifetime! My "new" favorite foods are my famous vegetable soup, smoothies, and best of all, my evening bowl of fresh pineapple with frozen blueberries and blackberries.

This diet style has brought me other life benefits as well: I no longer need a daily nap, for instance, and I run 7.5 miles a day. A nutritarian diet has also eliminated my cravings for toxic foods. And another added benefit: Old friends and relatives can't believe how good I look!

½ cup old-fashioned oats

1 cup water

2 apples, peeled, cored, and diced

¼ teaspoon ground Ceylon cinnamon (see Note)

2 pitted dates, finely chopped

2 tablespoons chopped walnuts

Place oats and water in small pot and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in apples, ground cinnamon, and chopped dates. Add additional water if desired to adjust consistency. When oatmeal and apples are heated through, remove from heat and stir in walnuts.

*Note:* Ceylon cinnamon is known as "true cinnamon." What is commonly found in the United States is cassia cinnamon, a closely related and less expensive variety. Ceylon cinnamon is preferable because the cassia variety contains high levels of coumarin, a naturally occurring substance that has the potential to damage the liver in high doses. The Ceylon variety contains only traces of coumarin.

### Bean Burger Tips

Bean burgers are great because you probably have the ingredients on hand to make a batch at any given time. They work for a quick evening meal, and leftovers can be packed for lunch the next day. You can make them regular burger size or make smaller patties for bean burger sliders. Bean burger variations are endless, but my basic formula consists of beans, a source of fat such as seeds or nuts, a grain, and some veggies and flavoring ingredients. For example, my simple Sunny Bean Burgers contain just six ingredients: kidney or pinto beans, sunflower seeds, oats, minced onion, low-sodium ketchup, and a dash of chili powder.

#### **Bean Burger Ingredients**

*Beans:* You can use any variety of cooked, canned, or boxed beans—black, red kidney, pinto, or white beans; lentils or chickpeas. Mash them up well.

*Nut and Seeds:* Ground or chopped nuts and/or seeds provide the healthy fat.

*Grains:* Grains help to bind the other ingredients together. Oats are a common ingredient in bean burgers, but you can also use cooked rice, cooked quinoa, or a small amount of whole grain bread crumbs.

*Vegetables:* Diced mushrooms are great in burgers. In addition to adding a meaty texture, they provide *umami,* or the fifth taste in addition to sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. Umami is defined as robust, savory, and meaty. You can also add shredded carrots, chopped spinach, chopped kale, diced artichoke, or mashed sweet potato.

*Onions and Garlic:* Onions and garlic give a flavor boost without added salt. They are also in the *Allium* genus of vegetables, which have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular and immune systems.

*Tempeh:* Tempeh is made from cooked and slightly fermented soybeans that are formed into a firm patty. It provides an interesting flavor and chewiness and can be grated or crumbled and added to burgers.

*Tofu:* Freeze extra firm tofu, defrost it, squeeze out the excess moisture, and then crumble and add it to burgers for a light but chewy texture.

*continued*

*For Meat Lovers:* You don't really need meat since bean burgers taste so good, but if you want them to taste meaty, add 1 ounce of ground organic/wild meat or fowl per person for a burger that tastes even better than traditional all-beef patties.

*Toppings:* Add sliced red onion, sliced tomato, lettuce, avocado, sautéed mushrooms, and/or low-sodium/no-corn-syrup ketchup.

*Bread:* If desired, serve burgers on a small pita, half a roll, or a slice of bread. Make sure your bread choices are 100% whole grain. See page 271 for more advice on choosing bread products.

### **Sunny Bean Burgers**

#### Serves: 2

¼ cup sunflower seeds

2 cups cooked kidney or pinto beans, or canned no-salt-added or low-sodium kidney or pinto beans, drained

½ cup minced onion

2 tablespoons low-sodium ketchup

1 tablespoon old-fashioned rolled oats

½ teaspoon chili powder

Preheat oven to 350˚F. Lightly oil a baking sheet with a little olive oil on a paper towel. Chop sunflower seeds in a food processor or with a hand chopper. Mash beans in the food processor or with a potato masher and mix with the sunflower seeds. Mix in remaining ingredients and form into six patties.

Place patties on the baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly, until you can pick up each patty and compress it firmly in your hands to reform the burger. Return the patties to the baking sheet, bottom side up, and bake for another 10 minutes.

*Note:* If desired, you can cook these on a grill.

### **Choose Organic Meats**

If you choose to include a small amount of meat in your diet, select certified organic products. You can be sure that the animal feed is grown without chemical pesticides and the animal is not treated with antibiotics or hormones. The animals also must have access to outdoor exercise areas, sunlight, and pasture. Organic farms are monitored, and the producers are held responsible for their practices. "Natural" meats may follow some or all of the organic practices, but they don't have to. "Natural" as well as "grass fed" are voluntary terms and aren't monitored. They can refer to a wide range of practices.

### Healthy Bread Choices

If you choose to eat bread, don't make your decision on the basis of claims made on the front of the package. You need to learn about the different options and look at the fine print on the list of ingredients.

*Whole Grain Bread:* "Whole grain" means that all parts of the grain are still present. A whole grain has three components:

*Germ:* The embryo or sprouting section of the seed.

*Endosperm:* The bulk of the interior of the seed.

*Bran:* The outer layer that holds everything together.

When wheat is refined to make white flour, the bran and germ are stripped away, along with most of the nutrients, leaving only the endosperm, which is ground into flour. Look for breads that contain only 100 percent whole grains. Breads that are made with whole grains that are more coarsely ground are the healthiest choice. The more finely ground the grain, such as whole wheat pastry flour, the higher the glycemic load. Breads that are labeled "made with whole grains" often contain some whole grain but include refined flour as well. In addition to wheat, whole grain products can be made with barley, millet, rye, brown rice, and oats. Intact whole grains have not been ground into flour and are usually eaten after being softened by boiling.

*Sprouted Grain Bread:* Sprouted grain breads are made from whole wheat kernels or other whole grains that are allowed to sprout and then are ground up. As far as nutrition goes, they are the best whole grain choice.

*Whole wheat bread:* Whole wheat bread is a type of whole grain bread made from whole wheat flour. Look for bread made from 100 percent whole wheat flour. This should be the first ingredient listed and the only flour mentioned in the ingredients. Many products claiming to be "whole wheat" are simply white bread with a little extra whole wheat flour added, along with some food coloring.

*Multigrain and Seeded Breads:* Breads containing mixed grains and seeds can appear to be healthful, but many of them fall short when compared with 100 percent whole wheat or 100 percent whole grain breads. Some consist mainly of processed white flour, with grains and seeds making up only a small proportion of the ingredients. A "multigrain" label only tells you that the bread contains different kinds of grains; it doesn't mean they haven't been refined.

*White Bread:* You should avoid white bread because it lacks the nutrients contained in less processed grain products. Some labeling terms can be misleading and make products appear healthful. The terms "wheat flour"; "unbleached wheat flour"; "enriched wheat flour"; "stone-ground wheat flour"; "multigrain," "five grain," or "seven grain"; and "100 percent wheat flour or bran" are all sometimes merely a way of saying "refined white flour." Wheat flour is just another name for white flour. Any time you see "enriched," you know that you're getting white flour. Flour that has been refined and stripped of its bran and germ must have some of the B vitamins and iron replaced by enrichment.

In addition to the form of grain used in a bread product, watch out for unhealthy fats. Don't choose a product that contains hydrogenated vegetable oil, *trans* fats, partially hydrogenated oil, or vegetable oil shortening. Also avoid products containing high-fructose corn syrup or a high level of sodium. A slice of bread should contain no more than 180 milligrams of sodium per slice and should provide at least 3 grams of fiber.

Table 19 lists some bread products that I recommend.

# Appendix: Considering Supplements

Once you start to eat healthfully, using supplements judiciously and conservatively is often a wise choice. Your diet may be the major part of the health pie, but it is not the whole pie. It's also necessary to assure that you aren't hurting yourself with the wrong nutritional supplements. Remember: Too little of something can be suboptimal, but too much can be as well. We have to be cautious and informed to do the right thing, because very few people understand these complicated issues.

Certain supplemental ingredients are controversial, and my comprehensive review of the available science reveals that many of the synthetic elements in typical multivitamins have, alarmingly, been linked to an increased risk of cancer. Proving a definitive link between a supplement and cancer takes many years to accomplish. Don't be persuaded by a five-year study looking at the potential cancer-promoting risks of folic acid and claiming that it's safe. Five years simply isn't long enough for the potential risk to arise. We must give heavier weight to studies that look at outcomes after ten to thirty years.

It's also still important to consider that even the healthiest diet may not supply you with the optimal amount of every potentially beneficial substance or nutrient. Supplementing those nutrients may be advantageous for long-term health.

### **Use supplements wisely and conservatively to assure that no deficiencies exist.**

Just because almost all multivitamins contain some questionable and potentially cancer-promoting ingredients doesn't mean that all supplements are harmful or worthless. Certainly, not all supplemental ingredients are potentially harmful; many have significant benefits. A healthy diet might contain suboptimal levels of vitamins B12 and D, and for many people the levels of other critical elements may be similarly suboptimal. People aren't carbon copies of one another. Scientific literature points to the potential health problems that may arise from deficiency and insufficiency, and my decades spent examining the blood of thousands of patients have made clear that some people need supplementation of certain nutrients to maximize their health potential.

Traditional multivitamins, however, aren't the best answer. Some studies on multivitamins show benefits, and others don't; but it's not good science to look at studies on multivitamins as a whole because there are too many variables mixed together. Multivitamins are most often a combination of harmful substances and potentially helpful substances. My review of all the literature on the individual supplemental ingredients has led me to strongly advise against taking standard multivitamins that contain folic acid, beta-carotene, vitamin A (acetyl and retinyl palmitate), vitamin E, selenium, copper, and for men and postmenopausal women, iron.

### **Folic Acid**

Stay away from folic acid, which is the synthetic form of folate, a member of the family of B vitamins. Synthetic folic acid found in supplements has a different chemical structure than natural folate, which is found abundantly in natural food, particularly green vegetables and beans. Your body processes folate and folic acid differently. Folic acid is about twice as absorbable as natural folate, and once absorbed it must be modified before it can act as folate.1 Your body can convert only so much folic acid into folate, so too much folic acid enters the blood and tissues as unmodified folic acid.2 Exactly what unmodified folic acid does in the human body is unclear, but there is evidence that it can disrupt normal folate metabolism and promote cancer growth. Taking synthetic folic acid has been linked to an increased risk of developing breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers.3 For example, a ten-year study on women taking multivitamins concluded that those who took multivitamins containing folic acid increased their breast cancer risk by 20 to 30 percent.4 A 2011 meta-analysis of six folic acid supplementation trials similarly found that the incidence of all cancers was 21 percent higher in the groups that received folic acid supplements.5 In contrast, higher consumption of natural food folate helps to prevent breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers.6 There is simply too much evidence to ignore. We must be cautious and avoid supplementing our diets with folic acid.

Fortunately, you don't really need to take extra folic acid, because natural folate is abundant in green vegetables, beans, and other plant foods. A nutritarian diet supplies you with enough folate for your body to function properly. Folate is essential for several chemical reactions related to DNA production, including methylation and repair mechanisms, crucial steps in the division of cells. Folate is also important for normal fetal development and support of normal immune function to fight against cancer.7 Folate has become widely known for protecting against neural tube defects in developing babies.

The U.S. government and health authorities insist that women who may become pregnant take supplemental folic acid, rather than recommending that they eat green vegetables, which contain folate in addition to hundreds of other cancer-protective micronutrients. This pill-for-every-ill mentality may create new problems, such as an increase in childhood cancers and breast cancer. Every woman should be aware that no supplement can substitute for healthful eating. Eating folaterich foods during pregnancy may also offer protection against cardiac birth defects, childhood respiratory illnesses, and childhood cancers.8

Since folate is most important very early on in pregnancy, the most important thing women can do to prevent neural tube defects and protect their unborn child from other health problems is to consistently eat plenty of greens and other folate-rich foods before becoming pregnant and during pregnancy. Folic acid is a weak substitute for the real thing.

### **Beta-Carotene**

Beta-carotene—along with alpha-carotene, lutein, and lycopene—is one of more than six hundred carotenoids, the yellow, orange, and red pigments that have antioxidant activity and are present in fruits and vegetables. Beta-carotene is a provitamin A carotenoid, which means that it is converted to vitamin A in the body. Carotenoids contribute to proper immune function and vision and defend the body's tissues against oxidative damage. This helps to prevent chronic diseases and premature aging.9

Early observational studies have found that individuals with higher beta-carotene blood levels had lower risks of cancer, and interventional studies using beta-carotene and vitamin A supplements followed. However, beta-carotene supplements were unable to produce the beneficial effects of carotenoid-rich plant foods. In fact, supplementation with beta-carotene was associated with an increased risk of cancer and premature death.10 A meta-analysis of many studies of antioxidant vitamin supplementation found that vitamin A supplements were associated with a 16 percent increased risk of death, beta-carotene a 7 percent increase, and vitamin E a 4 percent increase.11 It is possible that beta-carotene from supplements could interfere with the absorption of other anticancer carotenoids, such as lutein and lycopene.12

The precise reason for the increased risk is not clear. What is clear, however, is that beta-carotene supplementation is a poor substitute for the more than six hundred carotenoids found in nature. It's possible for nutrients in isolation (in supplemental form) and at high doses to act differently in the body than when they are derived from foods and naturally balanced with other nutrients. A nutritarian diet style provides a more than adequate supply of carotenoids; therefore, supplemental beta-carotene and vitamin A simply are not needed—and they may be risky. We should not be taking supplements that increase the risk of disease. Get your beta-carotene from food, not supplements.

### **Vitamin A**

Vitamin A (acetyl or retinyl palmitate) is likely the most dangerous supplement of all. In addition to the 16 percent increased risk of death found in a meta-analysis of vitamin A supplementation trials,13 high doses of supplemental vitamin A may also increase calcium loss. It has also been linked to an increased incidence of hip fractures.14 And excess vitamin A can cause liver damage and birth defects.15

### **Vitamin E**

Vitamin E encompasses a number of similar fat-soluble compounds found primarily in nuts and seeds such as almonds, hazelnuts, and sunflower seeds. The multiple vitamin E fragments they contain, coupled with other healthful compounds, result in health benefits that you simply cannot obtain from a vitamin E supplement. When one fragment of vitamin E is isolated and supplemented, according to hundreds of studies, these benefits are lost. Similar to vitamin A and beta-carotene, vitamin E supplements were found to not be protective, and a small increase in the risk of death was reported in a recent meta-analysis.16 Though hardly the most harmful of supplemental ingredients, vitamin E supplements do not give you the best benefit-to-risk ratio. Vitamin E is important, but it's best to get vitamin E from nuts and seeds.

### **Selenium**

Selenium deficiency is definitely harmful and usually the result of a steady diet of refined foods, or malnourishment. It is also sometimes related to gastric bypass surgery. A nutritarian diet prevents selenium deficiency.

While selenium deficiency is harmful, too much selenium can be harmful too, which is why taking selenium in supplemental form is so risky. Recently, evidence has emerged that high selenium levels may be associated with diabetes, elevated cholesterol levels, prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, and impaired immune and thyroid function. There is also a link between selenium excess and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).17 In light of these studies, I advise avoiding supplemental selenium. You will automatically get sufficient selenium from a healthy diet, so you won't need this ingredient in a supplement.

### **Copper and Iron**

Copper and iron are essential minerals. Iron is crucial for oxygen transport in the blood, and both iron and copper take part in many of the body's vital chemical reactions. The human body stores excess iron and copper, and as we age these metals may build up and become toxic. Iron, in excess, also has pro-oxidant effects that may contribute to cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline in older adults.18 Excess copper intake, especially when in conjunction with high saturated and *trans* fat intake, may also contribute to cardiovascular disease and accelerate cognitive decline in older adults.19

The most common sources of excess iron and copper are red meat and multivitamins. One of the negative health effects of red meat is due to its heme iron, which is too readily absorbed. Adequate, but not excessive, amounts of iron and copper are found in plant foods.

Excess iron is somewhat less of a concern for menstruating women compared with men because women lose some iron as a result of menstruation. Some women who have a heavier menstrual flow each month and who absorb iron less efficiently may require more iron than natural plant foods can supply. However, keep in mind that the health benefits of a nutritarian diet and lower body fat stores include reduced menstrual pain and menstrual bleeding over time, which would also reduce iron requirements. So the amount of iron menstruating women need can be relative to the amount of blood they lose each month, their dietary choices, and their differences in absorption of iron.

The primary issue for men and postmenopausal women is to not consume excess iron. Eating red meat can result in your getting too much iron, which can increase your risk of heart disease and dementia. The iron from supplements is not as well absorbed as the iron in meat, so a low-dose iron supplement may be helpful if an increased need exists from heavy menstrual flow. Low iron levels can cause fatigue, even when anemia is not present. Also, iron deficiency in infants and toddlers can retard brain development and intelligence, so it's important that pregnant and nursing mothers aren't deficient in iron. A blood test showing a ferritin level lower than 50ng/ml indicates a need for iron. Supplemental iron should be taken only when there is a deficiency or increased biological need, such as during pregnancy or in premenopausal women who are experiencing excessive bleeding.

### **Vitamin B12**

Vitamin B12 is involved in red blood cell production and keeps the nervous system working properly. Vitamin B12 deficiency can elevate the amino acid homocysteine, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and cause a number of serious health problems, including anemia, depression, confusion, fatigue, digestive issues, and nerve damage.20 As we get older, our ability to absorb vitamin B12 from food begins to decline. In fact, about 20 percent of adults older than sixty have insufficient vitamin B12 levels, and insufficient B12 levels are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.21 In addition, vitamin B12 is made exclusively by microorganisms, which means that animal products are the only dependable source of it. Soil contains vitamin B12–producing microorganisms, but since we wash produce before we eat it, most of us are unable to get sufficient vitamin B12 from plant foods alone. Therefore, vitamin B12 supplementation beyond what is found in a nutritarian diet is necessary.

### **Vitamin D**

Vitamin D is produced by the skin in response to exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays. It regulates bone density by increasing the intestinal absorption of calcium and promoting the activity of bone-building cells. Although it is most known for its role in bone health, recent evidence has shown that vitamin D has important functions relevant to many other aspects of human health.22 Insufficient vitamin D levels are associated with several cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and autoimmune diseases.23 And a number of studies have now found correlations between low vitamin D levels and increased risk of death from all causes.24 Higher blood levels of vitamin D, on the other hand, have been associated with reduced risk of several cancers.25 One newly published study found that a doubling of vitamin D level resulted in a 20 to 23 percent reduced likelihood of mortality over thirteen years of follow-up.26

Because of our indoor jobs, our climate, and the risk of skin damage and skin cancer from overexposure to sunlight, it's very difficult to achieve optimal levels of vitamin D safely from the sun. Since the current Institute of Medicine recommendations on vitamin D intake fall below what many scientists believe to be an adequate daily dose for most people, most multivitamins do not contain enough vitamin D to constitute a healthy vitamin D level. In my experience, 2000 IU is an appropriate dose that most consistently brings most people into the favorable range for 25-hydroxy vitamin D on their blood test. My thorough review of all the science on this issue indicates a blood test range of 25 to 45 nanograms per milliliter is ideal. I have drawn thousands of vitamin D blood tests on patients over the years, and found severe deficiencies of vitamin D to be very common. I do recommend having a blood test every few years to determine your vitamin D level to assure adequacy and to make sure you are not taking too much supplemental vitamin D, which could also be harmful.

### **Zinc**

A cofactor in hundreds of chemical reactions, zinc is an important contributor to gene expression, immune function, cell growth, and reproduction. An adequate level of zinc is necessary for optimal resistance against infection, which is especially important for the elderly as immunity and disease resistance wane with aging. Although the zinc content of whole plant foods is adequate, zinc isn't as readily absorbed from plant sources compared with animal sources. This is because zincrich plant foods also contain substances, such as phytates,27 that reduce zinc absorption. Suboptimal levels of zinc therefore are more likely to occur in people who eat low-calorie vegan and near-vegan diets. It is estimated that zinc requirements for people following a completely vegan diet are approximately 50 percent higher than for non-vegans.28

Zinc may be especially important for men, since blood zinc levels of men with prostate cancer tend to be lower than in healthy men, and long-term zinc supplementation has been associated with a decreased risk of advanced prostate cancer.29 Supplementation with a low dose of zinc, 10 to 15 milligrams, seems wise.

### **Iodine**

Iodine is involved in the production of thyroid hormones. Most plant foods are low in iodine, largely because of soil depletion. Studies have shown that iodine deficiency is common in vegans and vegetarians.30

Kelp, a sea vegetable, is a good source of iodine, but only a pinch (onetenth teaspoon) is an appropriate dose. It could provide excessive amounts of iodine if the amounts consumed aren't carefully measured and limited. Since the primary source of iodine in the American diet is iodized salt, it may be important to supplement your iodine intake because a nutritarian diet minimizes added salt. Since both too little and too much iodine can have a negative effect on thyroid function, taking 150 micrograms a day is sufficient and protective.

#### **Only the optimal choice of food can result in optimal health.**

The right foods are still the only answer to excellent health because supplements can never supply the broad diversity and comprehensive array of immune system–supporting nutrients that we need for superior health and a long life. There is simply no substitute for eating nutrient-rich vegetation.

Supplements can add exposure to beneficial substances not found in optimal amounts in one's diet, but we always have to keep in mind that both deficiencies and excesses of individual nutrients can be problematic and many supplements, because they may contain higher amounts of individual nutrients than can be utilized by the body, can push people up to a harmful level of intake. Remember, even too much clean water can be harmful.

So though we should maintain adequate intake of DHA, B12, zinc, iodine, and Vitamin D, we should also be aware that taking too much can also be harmful. I want you to aim for comprehensive nutritional adequacy, not excess. Modern nutritional science directs us to combine the optimal diet with the judicious use of supplements to adequately meet our needs. When you do this, you achieve a zone of excellence, rarely achieved by humans in prior generations or even in our world today, and you have a unique opportunity in human history to live better, healthier and longer than ever before.
